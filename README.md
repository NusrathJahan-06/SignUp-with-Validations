# SignUp-with-Validations
I have created the Sign up page where the Username and Password is the required/mandatory fields. The length of the password is maximum 8.If the length is less than 8 then it won't go to the next page. If it is greater than 8 then it will display the Information as "You have Designed an Interactive page having good CSS The signup was successful"
